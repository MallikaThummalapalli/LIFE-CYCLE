  <!-- Clear explanations for each stage -->
  <dl>
    <dt><h2>Plan</h2></dt>
    <dd>
      Define business goals and user requirements, identify scope and success criteria, and agree on
      a roadmap, timelines, and responsibilities. Output: a prioritized backlog and architecture outline.
    </dd>

    <dt><h2>Develop</h2></dt>
    <dd>
      Write, review, and refactor code using version control and branching strategies. Emphasize code
      quality with peer reviews and static analysis. Output: merge-ready source code.
    </dd>

    <dt><h2>Build</h2></dt>
    <dd>
      Compile and package the application into artifacts (containers/binaries). Automate with CI to ensure
      repeatable, reliable builds. Output: tested build artifacts ready for promotion.
    </dd>

    <dt><h2>Test</h2></dt>
    <dd>
      Validate functionality, performance, security, and compatibility using unit, integration, end-to-end,
      and security tests. Fail fast and surface feedback to developers. Output: test reports and quality gate status.
    </dd>

    <dt><h2>Release</h2></dt>
    <dd>
      Approve a version for production by meeting quality gates and compliance checks. Prepare release notes
      and a rollback plan. Output: a signed, approved release candidate.
    </dd>

    <dt><h2>Deploy</h2></dt>
    <dd>
      Roll out to production (blue-green, canary, or rolling). Manage configuration and secrets and verify
      post-deployment health. Output: live application instance(s).
    </dd>

    <dt><h2>Operate</h2></dt>
    <dd>
      Run the application reliably—handle capacity, scaling, backups, incident response, and change management.
      Aim for high availability and resilience. Output: stable, performant operations.
    </dd>

    <dt><h2>Monitor</h2></dt>
    <dd>
      Observe logs, metrics, and traces; track user experience and business KPIs; detect anomalies and
      feed insights back to planning for continuous improvement. Output: actionable telemetry and feedback.
    </dd>
